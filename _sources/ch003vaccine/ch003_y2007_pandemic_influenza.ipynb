    "\n",
    "Influenza viruses are enveloped ribonucleic acid viruses belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviridae and are divided into three distinct types on the basis of antigenic differences of internal structural proteins (Ref. 2).  Two influenza types, Type A and B, are responsible for yearly epidemic outbreaks of respiratory illness in  humans and are further classified based on the structure of two major external glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).  Type B viruses, which are largely restricted to the human host, have a single HA and NA subtype.  In contrast, numerous HA and NA Type  A influenza subtypes have been identified to date.  Type A strains infect a wide variety of avian and mammalian species. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type A and B influenza variant strains emerge  as a result of frequent antigenic change, principally from mutations in the HA and NA gl ycoproteins.  These variant strains may arise through one of two mechanisms:  se lective point mutations in the viral genome (Refs. 3 and 4) or from reassortment between two co-circulating strains (Refs. 5 and 6).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 1977, influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation in humans.  The current U.S. licensed trivalent vaccines are formulated to prevent influenza illness caused by these influenza viruses (Ref. 7).  Pandemic influenza outbreaks have occurred when a new Type A hemagglutinin subtype emerges to which the population has not been expos ed and has little or no immunity.  During the twentieth century, three pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred.  \n",

    "Pandemic influenza strains can evolve following genetic reassortment of two co-circulating viruses, one of which originates from an animal reservoir and one from human orig in.  Such a reassortment led to the emergence of the **1957 H2N2** subtype pandemic strain and the **1968 H3N2** subtype pandemic strain.  Recent research suggests that the **1918-1919 H1N1** subtype pandemic strain likely resulted from a series of genetic mutations in multiple genes in an influenza strain of avian origin.  These mutations appear to have allowed the virus to adapt to and spread among humans (Refs. 8, 9, and 10).  The 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic strain, the most lethal of  the twentieth century, resulted in about 50 million deaths worldwide (Ref. 11).  The genetic sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and reconstruction of the 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic strain have provided important insights into virulence factors of influenza viruses (Refs. 9 and 10).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, human infections with avian influenza viruses have led to increasing concern that one or more of these viral strains may evolve into  a pandemic viral strain that is able to spread among humans.  Several avian subtypes have be en recovered from humans with influenza illness.  Influenza H7N7, H9N2 and H5N1 subtype strains have caused disease in humans (Refs. 12, 13, 14, and 15).  Of these, the H5N1 strains have raised particular concern.  Strains of this subtype are highly virulent with a mortality rate of approximately 50 percent among confirmed clinical cases.  The first documented human H5N1 infections occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 in individuals, 6 of whom died.  While only rare cases of possible human-to-human transmission have occurred to date (Refs. 16 and 17), the number of human infections continues to increase, and analysis of H5N1 strains isolated from mo re recent human infections has shown that the virus continues to mutate and that new variants have emerged. ^2 Of additional concern, recent H5N1 strains are more lethal in animal models, and the host range for H5N1 strains has expanded into mammalian species previously thought to be resistant to avian strains.  These events have highlighted the need to develop criteria to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines directed against potential pandemic strains. \n",

Approval under this section will be subject to the requirement that the sponsor st udy the biological product further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit (21 CFR 601.41).  Postmarketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled and should be conducted with due diligence (21 CFR 601.41).  The protocols for these studies should be submitted with the original BLA.  Marketing approval for biological products approved under these regulations may be withdrawn, for example, if the postmarketing clinical study fails to verify clinical benefit or the sponsor fails to perform the require d postmarketing study with due diligence (21 CFR 601.43(a)(1) and (2)).  \n",

    "For pandemic influenza vaccines, the immune response elicited following receipt of the vaccine may serve as a surrogate endpoint that is  likely to predict clinic al benefit, that is, prevention of influenza illness and its complications.  Influenza virus hemagglutinins, present on viral surfaces, are important for cell-receptor binding.  The immune response to these hemagglutinins as measured by the presence of serum HI antibodies is an important protective component following vaccination and/or infection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To date, prospectively designed studies to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines have not identified a specific HI anti body titer associated with protection against culture-confirmed influenza illness.  Some  studies of influenza infection, including human challenge studies following vaccination, have suggested that HI antibody titers ranging from 1:15 to 1:65 may be associated  with protection from illness in 50% of subjects and that protection from illness is incr eased with higher titers (Refs. 19 and 20).  Evaluations of seroconversion and GMT have be en used as measures of vaccine activity (Refs. 21 and 22).  \n",

In addition, all sponsors who seek licensure of a pandemic influenza vaccine through accelerated appr oval should expect FDA to seek their involvement in working with FDA and other governmental agencies on plans to collect additional effectiveness and safety informati on, such as through epidemiological studies, when the vaccine is used.  Since each vaccine candidate is unique (e.g., particular product  characteristics, manufacturing process, etc.), we recommend that you discuss with CBER early in development the adequacy of the manufacturing methods and product testing and the extent of the clinical data needed to license your candidate vaccine. \n"

    "\n",
    "This Section describes possible approaches  for establishing effectiveness based on immune responses under an accelerated approval.  Because our understanding of immune responses to various possible pandemic strains is evolving, the effectiveness criteria stated below are current recommended targets.  We are open to considering other study designs, other surrogate endpoints reasonably likely to predict benefit, along with other proposed performance targets for the surrogate endpoints described below or for other surrogate endpoints.   \n",

In a prepandemic setting it is  likely that most subjects will not have been exposed to the pandemic influenza viral antigen(s).  Therefore, it is possible that vaccinated subjects may r each both suggested endpoints.  Thus, for studies enrolling subjects who are immunologically naïve to the pandemic influenza antigen, one HI antibody assay endpoint, such as the percentage of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer > 1:40, may be considered.  \n",

The monitoring of these subjects should follow the outline described in Section III.A.2. above.  The data gathered six months post-vaccination evaluation should be submitted to FDA at the time of the BLA submission.  In addition, safety laboratory tests, including hematologic and clinical chemistry evaluations, should be obtained pre- and post-vaccination at least in the first clinical study(ies).\n",
    "\n",
    "These may be needed in other studies, depending on the initial clinical studies and pre-clinical data.  A total safety database large enough to rule out a serious adverse event that occurs at a rate of 1 in 300 may be sufficient when a sponsor  has adequate marketing and safety experience with the same manufacturing process for a seasonal vaccine licensed outside the United States and these data are presented in the BLA and assessed as such.  For example, the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the true serious adverse event rate is 0.0032 (<1 in 300) when no serious adverse event is observed among 1150 subjects who received vaccine in the clinical trials, using the Clopper-Pearson method.  However, the size of the pre-licensure safety database, especially for vaccines manufactured using novel processes, such as cell-culture, and for pandemic vaccines th at contain novel adjuvants, would be influenced by factors such as the nature of the new manufacturing process and available preclinical and clinical data and should be discussed with CBER.  Moreover, if a serious adverse event is present in a safety database of about 1,000 subjects, and there is concern that it may be vaccine-related, then additional safety data may be needed.  Safety data to support use in pediatric populations would also be needed and should be submitted either  as part of the BLA or as a clinical efficacy supplement at a later time, if pe diatric studies are deferred under PREA.

    "### D. Additional Considerations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Types of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations in Section III.C. above , regarding clinical data to support the accelerated approval of a pandemic vaccine, apply to both nonadjuvanted and adjuvanted hemagglutinin-based pandemic vaccines, including \"split virus,\" subunit, and whole virus inactivated vaccines propagated in embryonated chicken eggs or cell-culture, and to recombinant hemagglutinin-based protein vaccines, and DNA vaccines that express hemagglutin in.  Detailed information on product characteristics and manufacturing processes are needed for all new vaccines, regardless of their derivation (see footnote 1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Clinical Lot Consistency \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of a clinical lot consistency study is to show consistency of manufacturing and performance of the final product by demonstrating that three consecutively manufactured final formulated  bulk lots of vaccine elicit equivalent immune responses.  The HI antibody assay may be used to assess the immune responses.  We recommend a pair-wise comparison of the 95% CI on the ratio of GMTs for the viral strain contained in th e three vaccine lots as an appropriate primary endpoint.  The two-sided 95% CI  on the GMT ratio should be entirely within 0.67 and 1.5.  Seroconversion rates for the HI antibody response for the viral strain contained in the vaccine may be assessed as secondary endpoints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment of lot consistency may be inco rporated in studies designed to support the accelerated approval of a new influenza vaccine.  We may decide, on a case by case basis, that lot consistency may be evaluated and incorporated in the postmarketing commitment studies.  This  determination would be influenced by factors such as the manufacturing pro cess used for the pandemic influenza vaccine and available manufactur ing and clinical experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Adjuvanted Pandemic Vaccines \n",
    "\n",
    "Small studies of inactivated nonadjuvante d pandemic influenza vaccines have shown that more antigen per dose and more than one dose are likely to be needed to elicit immune responses comparable to  those elicited following a single dose of an annual seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (Ref. 23).  An effective adjuvant might reduce the amount of antigen needed  to elicit protective immune responses and may also have other desirable propert ies, such as cross protection against evolving strains and priming the immune system in a prepandemic setting.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Data supporting the safety of the adjuvanted formulation and the added benefit over the unadjuvanted formulation must  be submitted in the BLA (42 U.S.C. (a)(2)(C)(i); 21 CFR 601.2).  At an early stage of development, clinical data supporting the value of adding the adjuvant should be provided, such as evidence of enhanced immune response, antigen-sparing effects, or other advantages, as should data supporting selection of the dose of the adjuvant itself.  Safety information in the BLA may include the safety experience obtained from domestic or foreign trials.  Safety experience from the same adjuvant formulated with other vaccine antigens may also contribute to the adjuvant's safety evaluation.  It is expected that nonclinical and clinical information needed to support the safety of the adjuvant be discussed with us early in development.  Finally, to delineate additional information about the adjuvanted vaccine's safety profile, we may seek agreement from sponsors to conduct certain postmarketing studies.   \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dose and Formulation Selection \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the vaccine is a hemagglutinin-based product, the HI antibody assay may be appropriate to evaluate the immune response.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For initial dose and formulation selection, a comparative clinical study of adjuvanted vs. non-adjuvanted vaccines that both contain the same amount of antigen should demonstrate that the immune response elicited by the adjuvanted antigen is better than that elicited by the same antigen alone.  For differences in HI antibody titer and seroconversion rates, the lower confidence limit on the appropriate point estimate excl uding equality (i.e., the value 1 for the ratio parameter or 0 for the difference parameter) may be sufficient to demonstrate the added value of the adjuvant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A comparative study of an adjuvanted vaccine containing a lower amount of antigen than the dose-optimized non-adjuvanted vaccine formulation may be conducted to demonstrate non-inferior  immune responses elicited by the adjuvanted vaccine.  Other approaches to demonstrate the value of the adjuvant, such as a greater ability of an adjuvanted vaccine to induce antibodies that cross-react with a wider variety of subtypes, strains, or clades, when compared to an unadjuvanted vaccine, may be possible.  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their proposals with CBER.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of an appropriate dose and formulation should also be guided by the safety profile of the formulations and regimens being studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Alternative Routes  of Administration \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative routes of influenza vaccine administration (e.g., transdermal inoculation by needle or transderma l vaccination using a patch, which may involve the use of novel devices) are being investigated with the goals of reducing the amount of antigen needed to elicit immune responses th at are likely to protect against influenza illness and of enhancing ease of vaccinations.  Such strategies might expand the available vaccine supply and/or increase the ease and speed of large scale immunization programs.  In cases where no novel manufacturing concerns are raised (such as intradermal administration of a pandemic vaccine formulation licensed for intramuscular administration) and the quantity and quality of the vaccine composition remains the same, approval may be possible as a clinical efficacy supplement to a BL A based on clinical immunogenicity and limited safety data.  In other cases or wh en a sponsor is uncertain about the data needed to support licensure of vaccines utilizing novel delivery methods, the sponsor should consult with CBER early in development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Investigating Schedules for Administration for Use Prior to a Pandemic \n",
    "\n",
    "Different schedules of influenza vaccine administration may also be investigated as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.  Studies may involve varying the number and strength of initial doses followed by a subsequent booster dose at different time periods using either homologous or heterologous antigen.  Results of these studies may generate information about  cross-reactive antibodies induced by novel antigens and may help inform public health decisions about developing potential antigen-sparing strategies.  Sponsors are encouraged to consider supplementing their product development pathway to include these studies and to consult with CBER about study design so that these studies could support evaluation and approval for such indications.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Pediatric Research Equity Act \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) (Public Law 108-155) addresses drug and biological product development for pediatric uses.  All sponsors have obligations to study pediatric populations as outlined in PREA.  Under PREA, all applications (or supplem ents) submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration are to cont ain a pediatric assessment (pediatric clinical data) unless the sponsor has obtained a waiver or deferral from FDA (21 U.S.C. 355c).  A draft guidance on the implementati on of PREA was issued by FDA in September 2005 (Ref. 24).  As stated in  that document, FDA encourages the submission of pediatric development plan s to FDA as early as possible in the vaccine development process to increase understanding of vaccine immunogenicity, dosing, and safety inform ation in the pediatric population.  The indication for a pandemic vaccine to be us ed during a pandemic is relevant for the pediatric population.  14 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Postmarketing Evaluations \n",
    "\n",
    "##### a. Effectiveness  \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Sections III.A. through C. above, pandemic influenza vaccines may be approved on the basis of  immunogenicity data.  All sponsors who seek licensure of a pandemic influenza vaccine, including those granted accelerated approval under 21 CFR 601.41, s hould expect FDA to seek their involvement in working with FDA and other governmental agencies on plans to collect additional safety and e ffectiveness data, such as through epidemiological studies, when the vacci ne is used.  Sponsors may indicate their intent in their BLA pharmacovigila nce plans.  The additional data may allow a better understanding of the relationship between immunogenicity of the vaccine and clinical effectiveness.  As discussed in Section III.C. above, for pandemic influenza vaccines appr oved under an accelerated approval, sponsors will also need to conduct a postmarketing confirmatory study to verify clinical benefit, and should include their study plans with their application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### b. Safety  \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the BLA submission, sponsors should include a pharmacovigilance plan in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH E2E guidance) (Ref. 25).  Special attention should be paid to safety issues that might arise because of n ovel manufacturing processes and/or novel adjuvants.  FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to conduct enhanced safety surveillance during early use of the vaccine, both prepandemic and during a pandemic.  FDA encourages sponsors to work in advance with us to develop safety surveillance strategies to best serve public health during a pandemic including the development and testing of postmarketing pandemic surveillance da ta gathering, communications, and reporting.     In addition, sponsors who wish to enhance the safety database and safety-related labeling of their pandemic use influenza vaccine may conduct safety studies prior to a pandemic influenza outbreak, for example among individuals identified by public health authorities for prepandemic vaccination.      \n",
