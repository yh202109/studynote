Method development involves optimising the procedures and conditions involved with extracting and detecting the analyte. \n",

    "\n",
    "Bioanalytical method validation is essential to ensure the acceptability of assay performance and the reliability of analytical results. A bioanalytical method is defined as **a set of procedures used for measuring analyte concentrations in biological samples**. A **full validation** of a bioanalytical method should be performed when establishing a bioanalytical method for the quantification of an analyte in clinical and in pivotal nonclinical studies. Full validation should also be performed when implementing an analytical method that is reported in the literature and when a commercial kit is repurposed for bioanalytical use in drug development. Usually one analyte has to be determined, but on occasion it may be appropriate to measure more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, **a parent drug** with its **metabolites** or the **enantiomers** or **isomers** of a drug. In these cases, the principles of validation and analysis apply to all analytes of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For chromatographic methods a full validation should include the following elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- selectivity, \n",
    "- specificity (if necessary), \n",
    "- matrix effect, \n",
    "- calibration curve (response function), \n",
    "- range (**lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)** to **upper limit of quantification (ULOQ)**), \n",
    "- accuracy, \n",
    "- precision, \n",
    "- carry-over, \n",
    "- dilution integrity, \n",
    "- stability and \n",
    "- reinjection reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "For LBAs the following elements should be evaluated: specificity, selectivity, calibration curve (response function), range (LLOQ to ULOQ), accuracy, precision, carry-over (if necessary), dilution linearity, parallelism (if necessary, conducted during sample analysis) and stability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix used for analytical method validation should be the same as the matrix of the study samples, including anticoagulants and additives. In some cases, it may be difficult to obtain an identical matrix to that of the study samples (e.g., rare matrices such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bile). In such cases surrogate matrices may be acceptable for analytical method validation. The surrogate matrix should be selected and justified scientifically for use in the analytical method. \n",

    "A specific, detailed, written description of the bioanalytical method should be established a priori. This description may be in the form of a protocol, study plan, report, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n"

    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Reference Standards \n",
    "\n",
    "During method validation and the analysis of study samples, a **blank biological matrix is spiked with the analyte(s) of interest** using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare **calibration standards, QCs and stability QCs**. **Calibration standards and QCs should be prepared from separate stock solutions**. However, calibration standards and QCs may be prepared from the same stock solution provided the **accuracy and stability of the stock solution** have been verified. \n",
    "\n",
    "A suitable **internal standard (IS)** should be added to all calibration standards, QCs and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be technically justified. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the **reference standard is well characterised** and the **quality (purity, strength, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured**, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality may be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterised standards prepared in-house or by an external non-commercial organisation. A **certificate of analysis (CoA)** or an equivalent alternative is required to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof. \n",
    "\n",
    "When MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labelled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is essential that the **labelled standard** is **of high isotope purity** and that **no isotope exchange reaction occurs**. The presence of unlabelled analyte should be checked and if unlabelled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Selectivity is **the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Selectivity is evaluated using **blank samples (matrix samples processed without addition of an analyte or IS)** obtained from at least **6 individual sources/lots** (non-haemolysed and non-lipaemic). Use of fewer sources may be acceptable in the case of rare matrices. Selectivity for the IS should also be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of selectivity should **demonstrate that no significant response attributable to interfering components is observed** at the retention time(s) of the analyte or the IS in the blank samples. Responses detected and attributable to interfering components should **not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ** and **not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample** for each matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the investigation of selectivity in **lipaemic matrices** at least one source of matrix should be used. To be scientifically meaningful, the matrix used for these tests should be representative as much as possible of the expected study samples. A naturally lipaemic matrix with abnormally high levels of triglycerides should be obtained from donors. Although it is recommended to use lipaemic matrix from donors, if this is difficult to obtain, it is acceptable to spike matrix with triglycerides even though it may not be representative of study samples. However, if the drug impacts lipid metabolism or if the intended patient population is hyperlipidaemic, the use of spiked samples is discouraged. This evaluation is not necessary for preclinical studies unless the drug impacts lipid metabolism or is administered in a particular animal strain that is hyperlipidaemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the investigation of selectivity in haemolysed matrices at least one source of matrix should be used. Haemolysed matrices are obtained by spiking matrix with haemolysed whole blood (at least 2% V/V) to generate a visibly detectable haemolysed sample.\n"

    "Specificity is the ability of a bioanalytical method to **detect and differentiate the analyte from other substances**, including its related substances (e.g., substances that are **structurally similar to the analyte, metabolites, isomer, impurities, degradation products** formed during sample preparation, or concomitant medications that are expected to be used in the treatment of patients with the intended indication).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the presence of related substances is anticipated in the biological matrix of interest, the impact of such substances should be evaluated during method validation, or alternatively, in the pre-dose study samples. In the case of LC-MS based methods, to assess the impact of such substances, the evaluation may include comparing the molecular weight of a potential interfering related substance with the analyte and chromatographic separation of the related substance from the analyte. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses detected and attributable to interfering components should not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ and not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample**. The possibility of back-conversion of a metabolite into the parent analyte during the successive steps of the analysis (including extraction procedures or in the MS source) should also be evaluated when relevant (i.e., potentially unstable metabolites such as ester analytes to ester/acidic metabolites, unstable N-oxides or glucuronide metabolites, lactone-ring structures). It is acknowledged that this evaluation will not be possible in the early stages of drug development of a new chemical entity when the metabolism is not yet evaluated. However, it is expected that this issue should be investigated and partial validation performed if needed.

The critical reagents should be identified and defined in the assay method.\n",

Additional characteristics may be warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical reagent lifecycle management procedure is necessary to ensure consistency between the original and new batches of critical reagents. Reagent performance should be evaluated using the bioanalytical assay. Minor changes to critical reagents would not be expected to influence the assay performance, whereas major changes may significantly impact the performance. If the change is minor (e.g., the source of one reagent is changed), a single comparative accuracy and precision assessment is sufficient for characterisation. If the change is major, then additional validation experiments are necessary. Ideally, assessment of changes will compare the assay with the new reagents to the assay with the old reagents directly. Major changes include, but are not limited to, change in production method of antibodies, additional blood collection from animals for polyclonal antibodies and new clones or new supplier for monoclonal antibody production.\n",

    "Retest dates and validation parameters should be documented in order to support the extension or replacement of the critical reagent. Stability testing of the reagents should be based upon the performance in the bioanalytical assay and be based upon general guidance for reagent storage conditions and can be extended beyond the expiry date from the supplier. The performance parameters should be documented in order to support the extension or replacement of the critical reagent."

    "### 7.1 Analytes that are also Endogenous Compounds \n",
    "\n",
    "For analytes that are also endogenous compounds, the accuracy of the measurement of the analytes poses a challenge when the assay cannot distinguish between the therapeutic agent and the endogenous counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The endogenous levels may vary because of age, gender, diurnal variations, illness or as a side effect of drug treatment. If available, biological matrix with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., endogenous level sufficiently low for the desired LLOQ, e.g., <20% of the LLOQ) should be used as blank matrix to prepare calibration standards and QCs since the biological matrix used to prepare calibration standards and QCs should be the same as the study samples (i.e., authentic biological matrix) and should be free of matrix effect and endogenous analyte at the level that causes interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In those cases where matrices without interference are not available, there are four possible approaches to calculate the concentration of the endogenous analyte in calibration standards, QCs and, consequently, study samples: 1) the standard addition approach, 2) the background subtraction approach, 3) the surrogate matrix (neat, artificial or stripped matrices) approach and 4) the surrogate analyte approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Standard Addition Approach:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Every study sample is divided into aliquots of equal volume. All aliquots, but one, are separately spiked with known and varying amounts of the analyte standards to construct a calibration curve for every study sample. The study sample concentration is then determined as the negative x-intercept of the standard calibration curve prepared in that particular study sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Background Subtraction Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The endogenous background concentrations of analytes in a pooled/representative matrix are subtracted from the concentrations of the added standards, subsequently the subtracted concentrations are used to construct the calibration curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Surrogate Matrix Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix of the study samples is substituted by a surrogate matrix. Surrogate matrices can vary widely in complexity from simple buffers or artificial matrices that try to mimic the authentic one, to stripped matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Surrogate Analyte Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable-isotope labelled analytes are used as surrogate standards to construct the calibration curves for the quantification of endogenous analytes. In this method it is assumed that the physicochemical properties of the authentic and surrogates analytes are the same with the exception of molecular weight. However, isotope standards may differ in retention time and MS sensitivity, therefore, before application of this  approach, the ratio of the labelled to unlabelled analyte MS responses (i.e., the response factor) should be close to unity and constant over the entire calibration range. \n",
    "\n",

A high concentration study sample (preferably close to Cmax) should be diluted to at least three concentrations with blank matrix. The precision between samples in a dilution series should not exceed 30%. However, when applying the 30% criterion, data should be carefully monitored as results that pass this criterion may still reveal trends of non-parallelism.

Recovery of the analyte does not need to be 100%, but the extent of recovery of an analyte and of the IS (if used) should be consistent.
